A Powershell script for printing entire folders of PPTX or DOCX files. The script is especially useful when paired with autogeneration software like Portant for automated generation and printing of documents like invoices or awards. 

Tips:
- Set default printer before use.
- Have a script ready to force the script to stop after all documents are printed. 
- Copy and add your folder's address before use. ($folderPath = "")
- A color printer is required for PPTX files with images.
